\item The exercises are from the textbook.  You are encouraged to work
      extra problems to aid in your learning; remember, the solutions to 
      the odd-numbered problems are in the back of the book.
\item Grading will be based on correctness, clarity, and whether your
      solution is of the appropriate length.
\item Always justify your answers.
\item Don't forget to acknowledge all sources of assistance in the section below, and write up your solutions on your own.
\item {\em Turn in .pdf file to Gradescope by the start of class on Monday, March 28, 2022.}  It is simpler to put each problem on its own page using the LaTeX clearpage command.
