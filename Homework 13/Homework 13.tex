Let $G=(V,T,S,P)$ be the phrase-structure grammar with $V=\{0, 1, A, S\},T=\{0, 1\}$, and set of productions $P$ consisting of $S\to1S,S\to00A,A\to0A$, and $A\to0.$
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Show that 111000 belongs to the language generated by $G$.\\
    $S\Rightarrow1S\Rightarrow11S\Rightarrow111S\Rightarrow11100A\Rightarrow111000$
    \item Show that 11001 does not belong to the language generated by $G$.\\
    Every production results in a string ending in $S,A$ or $0$. Therefore, any string ending with $1$ is not possible.
    \item What is the language generated by $G$?\\
    The string can start any number of 1’s, including zero, by iterating the production $S\to1S$.\\
    Eventually the $S$ must turn into $00A$, so at least two 0’s must come next.\\
    The string can then contain additional 0's using $A\to0A$ repeatedly.\\
    Because $A\to0$ is called at the end, this adds at least one more 0 (and therefore a total of at least three 0’s).\\
    So the language generated by $G$ is the set of all strings consisting of zero or more 1’s followed by three or more 0’s. We can write this as $\{0^n1^m\vert n\geq0$ and $m\geq3 \}$.
    
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
{\bf 18(a,c): (2 points).}

\noindent
Construct phrase-structure grammars to generate each of these sets.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item $\{01^{2n}\vert n\geq0\}$\\
    Exactly one 0. Followed by an even number of 1.\\
    $S\to0A$\\
    $A\to11A$\\
    $A\to\lambda$
    
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item $\{0^n1^m0^n\vert m\geq0\textrm{ and }n\geq0\}$\\
    Grow 0's from the center. Convert the center into a 1-making machine.\\
    $S\to0S0$\\
    $S\to A$\\
    $A\to1A$\\
    $A\to\lambda$

Let $G$ be the grammar with $V=\{a,b,c,S\};T=\{a, b, c\}$; starting symbol $S$; and productions $S\to abS, S\to bcS,S\to bbS,S\to a,$ and $S\to cb$. Construct derivation trees for $bbbcbba$.

Find the output generated from the input string $10001$ for the finite-state machine with the state diagram in
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Exercise 2(a).\\
    The machine starts in state $s_0$.\\
    On input $1$, it moves to state $s_2$ and outputs $0$.\\
    The next three inputs of 0's drive it to state $s_3$, then to $s_1$, then back to $s_0$. This will output $011$.\\
    The final $1$ drives it back to $s_2$ and outputs $0$.\\
    The output is $00110$.
    \item Exercise 2(b).\\
    The machine starts in state $s_0$.\\
    On input $1$, it moves to state $s_2$ and outputs $1$.\\
    The next three inputs of 0's keep it at $s_2$, outputting $1$ each time.
    The final $1$ drives it back to $s_0$ and outputs $0$.\\
    The output is $11110$.
    \item Exercise 2(c).\\
    The machine starts in state $s_0$.\\
    On input $1$, it moves to state $s_1$ and gives $1$ as output.\\
    The next input symbol is $0$, so the machine moves back to state $s_0$ and gives $0$ as output.\\
    The third input is $0$, so the machine moves to state $s_3$ and gives $0$ as output.\\
    The fourth input is $0$, so the machine moves to state $s_1$ and gives $0$ as output.\\
    The fifth input is $1$, so the machine stays in state $s_1$ and gives $1$ as output.\\
    The output is $10001$.

\noindent
Determine whether the string $01001$ is in each of these sets
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item \{0,1\}*\\
    This is the set of all bit strings. Therefore, the string is within the set.
    
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item \{010\}*\{0\}*\{1\}\\
    The string is $(010)^10^11$ so it is in the set.
    
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item \{00\}\{0\}*\{01\}\\
    Any string in this set must start with 00. Since the string does not, the string is not in the set.
